# Buildroot Files for Beaglebone Black

This branch contains the buildroot files for building the root filesystem for the Beaglebone Black hardware platform.

**Information:** This branch contains some elements in the /base_external/package/ directory that were created by Rushi Macwan for class assignment submissions. These elements have been kept as they were only for informational purposes and to showcase that the kernel transfer issue has been completed and tested for the Beaglebone Black hardware platform. With the sdcard.img file being flashed into the SD card for the Beaglebone Black, the hardware platform can run a similar instance as the QEMU with three modules being listed when the "lsmod" command is executed. The listed modules are: hello, scull, and aesdchar. Thanks.

**Please Note:** This branch is related with [Kernel Transfer Issue](https://github.com/cu-ecen-5013/final-project-assignment-sast7580/issues/2). This branch has been created based on the instructions and information provided at this [repository](https://github.com/cu-ecen-5013/buildroot-assignments-base.git).
