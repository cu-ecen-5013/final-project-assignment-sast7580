# Issues with running build.sh

Unfortunately, it still looks like there is a problem with the TI Server. I was unable to build the buildroot files for running the Python scripts for testing the RFID module.
I could test the script in the user-space using a Raspberry Pi instead. However, since the build fails, it was not possible to test it on the BBB.

[Error:]()
